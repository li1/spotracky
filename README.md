# Spotracky

Small app to create two Spotify playlists containing
1. songs that don't exist in any playlist
2. songs that aren't saved to library but exist in a playlist

# Running
1. `npm i`
2. `node app.js`
3. `localhost:8888`

# Note

Crudely adapted from https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples. Code isn't even cleaned up.
